# Chitter Frontend
A small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream. This is the frontend to a backend API that is hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. The API documentation is [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend).

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

Creating Users
Logging in
Posting Peeps
Viewing all Peeps (I suggest you start here)
Viewing individual Peeps
Deleting Peeps
Liking Peeps
Unliking Peeps
We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

## Using the app

1. `git clone https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/react-chitter-frontend.git`
2. `cd react-chitter-frontend`
3. `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

## Testing

Tests are written using Jest and Enzyme, to run tests use `npm test`. To run tests and see coverage use `npm test -- --coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Linting
ESLint has been used to lint, and any errors will show in the console while the server is running.

## Backlog
* Implement secure sign in and sign up
* Snap shot testing
