# Chitter Frontend
We are going to write a small Twitter clone that will allow the users to post messages to a public stream.

The scenario is similar to the Chitter Challenge, except someone has already built a backend API for you and hosted it on Heroku.

Your task is to build a front-end single-page-app to interface with this API. You can do this in any framework you like, or in pure Javascript. The API documentation is [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend).

Here are some interactions the API supports. Implement as many as you see fit.

Creating Users
Logging in
Posting Peeps
Viewing all Peeps (I suggest you start here)
Viewing individual Peeps
Deleting Peeps
Liking Peeps
Unliking Peeps
We are looking for well tested, easy to read, easy to change code. This is more important than the number of interactions you implement.

Note that others may be doing the same task at the same time, so the data may change as you are using it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
